Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
    VGG: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"
    AlexNet: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"
    ResNet: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"

    Answer: Yes, all three models (VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet) 
    classified the dog in Dog_01.jpg (rottw_dog.jpg) 
    as the same breed â€“ a rottweiler.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
    VGG:
        Dog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"
        Dog_02.jpg: Classified as "american staffordshire terrier, staffordshire terrier, american pit bull terrier, pit bull terrier" (partially correct - contains "Staffordshire bull terrier" which is close)
    AlexNet:
        Dog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"
        Dog_02.jpg: Incorrectly classified as "whippet"
    ResNet:
        Dog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as "rottweiler"
        Dog_02.jpg: Correctly classified as "Staffordshire bull terrier"
   
    Answer: No, not all models classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg 
    as different breeds ResNet was the only one to get both breeds correct. 
    VGG listed several terrier breeds, including 'Staffordshire terrier,' which is close to the actual breed.
    and AlexNet got it wrong and predicted it as "whippet".

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

    VGG:
        alaskan_malamute.jpg: Incorrectly classified as "Madagascar cat, ring-tailed lemur, lemur catta"
        coffee_mug.jpg: Incorrectly classified as "espresso"
    AlexNet:
        alaskan_malamute.jpg: Incorrectly classified as "spider monkey, ateles geoffroyi"
        coffee_mug.jpg: Correctly classified as "coffee mug"
    ResNet:
        alaskan_malamute.jpg: Correctly classified as "malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute"
        coffee_mug.jpg: Correctly classified as "coffee mug"

    Answer: ResNet correctly classified the Alaskan Malamute as a dog breed and the coffee mug as not a dog
    VGG misclassified both images, 
    and AlexNet misclassified the Alaskan Malamute.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: 
Based on the results data, ResNet performed the best:
Accuracy: It correctly classified all images (both breed and dog/not-dog).
Specificity: It distinguished between dog breeds effectively and didn't misclassify the non-dog images.

VGG had lower performance with both breed identification and differentiating dogs from other objects. 
AlexNet showed some improvement, but ResNet's performance suggests it has learned more robust and generalizable features for this image classification task.
